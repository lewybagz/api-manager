# Getting Started with ZekerKey

Welcome to ZekerKey — a secure, developer‑first credential manager.

## What is ZekerKey?

ZekerKey helps teams organize API keys and secrets by project. Secrets are encrypted in your browser before they are stored.

## Quick Start

1. Sign in or create an account.
2. Set your master password when prompted.
3. Create your first project.
4. Add a credential (name, optional username/ID, and the secret value).

## How we protect your data

- Client‑side encryption (AES‑GCM); keys derived from your master password.
- Your master password is never sent to our servers.
- Access is granted during your trial or with an active Pro subscription.

## Tips

- Use strong, unique master passwords.
- Group credentials by application and environment (e.g., app‑A / staging).
- Use notes to add context for future you and teammates.
