# ZekerKey Pro — Access Overview

Some features and documents require a Pro subscription. Here’s how access works.

## Trial access

- Every account starts with a 7‑day free trial.
- During the trial, you have the same access as Pro (unless stated otherwise).

## Pro subscription

- Price: $4.99/month billed annually ($59.88 per year).
- Payment is managed by Stripe.
- Use the same email as your ZekerKey login at checkout for instant linking.

## What happens after payment?

- You’ll be redirected back to ZekerKey.
- Your account is upgraded automatically within seconds.

## Cancelling

- If you cancel, you retain access until the end of the current billing period.

## Why a paywall?

- Sustains development of secure client‑side encryption, performance, and support.
- Keeps sensitive features behind verified accounts.
